            Haber left university to perform his One-year volunteer service in
            the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment. Upon its completion, he returned
            to Charlottenburg where he became a student of Carl Liebermann. In
            addition to Liebermann's lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also
            attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes.

            Haber and his assistant Robert Le Rossignol invented the Haber–Bosch
            process, which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen
            and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and
            pressure. <br />
            To further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production,
            Haber turned to industry. Teaming with Carl Bosch at BASF, the
            process was successfully scaled up to produce commercial quantities
            of ammonia. The Haber–Bosch process was a milestone in industrial
            chemistry. The production of nitrogen-based products such as
            fertilizer and chemical feedstocks, previously dependent on
            acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits, now became
            possible using an easily available, abundant base — atmospheric
            nitrogen. The ability to produce much larger quantities of
            nitrogen-based fertilizers in turn supported much greater
            agricultural yields and prevented billions of people from starving
            to death.

            Haber greeted World War I with enthusiasm, signing the Manifesto of
            the Ninety-Three. <br />Haber played a major role in the development
            of the non-ballistic use of chemical warfare in World War I, in
            spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the Hague
            Convention of 1907 (to which Germany was a signatory). <br />He was
            promoted to the rank of captain and made head of the Chemistry
            Section in the Ministry of War soon after the war began.
            <br />Regarding war and peace, Haber once said, "during peace time a
            scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to
            his country." This was an example of the ethical dilemmas facing
            chemists at that time.

            In addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other
            deadly gases for use in trench warfare, Haber was on hand personally
            when it was first released by the German military at the Second
            Battle of Ypres (22 April to 25 May 1915) in Belgium. Haber also
            helped to develop gas masks with adsorbent filters which could
            protect against such weapons. <br />
            In his studies of the effects of poison gas, Haber noted that
            exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time
            often had the same effect (death) as exposure to a high
            concentration for a short time. He formulated a simple mathematical
            relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary
            exposure time. This relationship became known as Haber's rule.

            development of chemical weapons, working with Hugo Stoltzenberg, and
            helping both Spain and Russia in the development of chemical gases.

            Haber was increasingly concerned about the rise of National
            Socialism in Germany, and the possible safety of his friends,
            associates, and family. Under the Law for the Restoration of the
            Professional Civil Service of 7 April 1933, Jewish scientists at the
            Kaiser Wilhelm Society were particularly targeted. <br />
            Haber was stunned by the following developments, since he assumed
            that his conversion to Christianity and his services to the state
            during World War I should have made him a German patriot.
